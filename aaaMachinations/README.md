## Bonding curve for machinations
Analyzing inflation and reserve for minting AAA, sAAAohm and wsAAAohm.  
https://my.machinations.io/d/AAA-PID-Controller/8a231d5caf7411ec8c2902f943517e50

wsAAAohm is backed by sAAAohm.  
sAAAohm is backed by AAA.  
AAA is backed by fiat money.  

Sigmoid curve is used for bonding curve.

More details about sigmoid curve is discussed on the first link of this page.  

## Python modules
Multiple python modules are developed to analyze inflation:  
BondingCurve  
SigmoidCurve  
Reserve  

## Todo list
Github actions for linting code.  
Autogenerate documentation for the python modules.
