# This is just a brainstorming, not actual implementation
Check out those Jupyter Notebook files to see general idea of this project.

## Development
1. Create virtual fish environment.  
`$ vf new aaa`  
1.1.(Optional) Connect that virtual environment to working directory.  This eliminates
the need to type virutal fish environment activate command.  
`$vf connect`
2. Download & install required packages.  
`$ pip install -r ../../requirements.txt`
3. Add virtual fish environment to Jupyter kernel.

4. Fire up Jupyter Notebook and play with the bonding curves.  
`$ jupyter notebook`
