On starting Attendee behaviour:

	Each player is assigned a pre-determined "buy" date
	So we don't have to waste CPU resources rolling a dice for them
	every time they go through their individual "day_assess".
	This also guarantees each Attendee will eventually buy,
	and not just leave it to a tweakable likelihood with no guarantees.

	Since sim_handler is in charge of instantiating all attendees
	based on received configurations, we'll also assign the "buy"
	date of each Attendee there.

	The logic for determining the buy date for each and every Attendee is
	as follows:

	ticket_sale_duration: int

	Let SimHandler receive the config parameter called "ticket_sale_duration"
	( Wait a sec, I think I can further enhance it by following a random normal distribution )
	Ticket sales are random but they're not that sporadic. There will be a section
	around the timeframe where the majority of the people buy.
